I’m tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
Don’t know what you’re expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)I’ve become so numb, I can’t feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I’m becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

Can’t you see that you’re smothering me
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control?
‘Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart right in front of you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can take

I’ve become so numb, I can’t feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I’m becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

And I know
I may end up failing too
But I know
You were just like me with someone disappointed in you

I’ve become so numb, I can’t feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I’m becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

I’ve become so numb, I can’t feel you there
(I’m tired of being what you want me to be)
I’ve become so numb, I can’t feel you there
(I’m tired of being what you want me to be)

Текст Allan Rayman – Pretty Please
It’s because we never speak and we don’t talk too much
And that’s alright with me, but I don’t have you enough
I always have to leave
And I can’t do that with a heart full of you
So why don’t you come with me?
Please‚ pretty please
Why don’t you come with me?
Please‚ pretty please
Why are you so scared of me? Well‚ you’re so immature
So in love with me and I can sort you out
Just tell me not to leave
And I’ll stay right here with a heart full of you
So tell me not to leave
Please, pretty please
Just tell me not to leave
Please, pretty please
If you got something to say
Don’t beat around the bush with me
Speak honestly
‘Cause I’ve had girls with their eyes full of love for me
But I only have eyes for you‚ for you, for you
It’s because we never speak and we don’t talk too much
And that’s alright with me, but I don’t have you enough
I always have to leave
And I can’t do that with a heart full of you
So why don’t you come with me?
Please‚ pretty please
Why don’t you come with me?
Please, pretty please
So why don’t you come with me?
Please, pretty please
